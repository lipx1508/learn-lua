# Chapter 1: Hello world!
The "Hello world!" example consists of the following code:

```lua
print("Hello world!")
```

```bash
Hello world!
```

Looks easy huh? Let's try to read the code by parts:
- **print** is a method used to write text into the console
- **(** indicates all the function arguments, which we will explain later on
- **"Hello world!"** is the text we want to write
- **)** closes the function arguments block

We will use this function to check the things we are doing.

## Some exercises
- Try changing the "Hello world" field to another text and see how it appears in the console (try adding an emoji to see how it looks too!).
- Duplicate the line and try printing more even text into the console.
