# Solutions for the chapter 2

## Exercise 1
Testing if a number is between 0 and 10 is easy!

```lua
number = 5
if number >= 0 and number <= 10 then
  print("number is between 0 and 10")
else
  print("number is not between 0 and 10")
end
```

If `number` is equal to 5:
```bash
number is between 0 and 10
```

If `number` is equal to -2:
```bash
number is not between 0 and 10
```
