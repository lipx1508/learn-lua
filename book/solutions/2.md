# Solutions for the chapter 2

## Exercise 1
To test if conditions are both true we use the `and` operator:

```lua
print((2 == 2) and (1 == 1))
```

```bash
true
```

## Exercise 2
You can also concatenate text with arithmetical operations and numbers:

```lua
print("2⁸ is equal to " .. 2 ^ 8)
print("The sun will enter it's red phase in aproximately " .. 5 .. " billion years from now!")
```

```bash
2⁸ is equal to 256.0
The sun will enter it's red phase in aproximately 5 billion years from now!
```
