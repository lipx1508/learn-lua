# Solutions for the "Hello world!" chapter

## Exercise 1.
You can add two numbers inside a variable by just using the operators after the `=`

```lua
a = 5 + 5
print(a)
```

```bash
10
```

## Exercise 2.
Multiplying is pretty simple, no worries! All you need to do is

```lua
a = 6
b = 3
c = a * b
print(c)
```

```bash
18
```

## Exercise 3.
Merging strings work the exact same way as we did in the `print("The text has " .. #"Hi!" .. " characters.")` example in chapter 2: the key difference is that it will be inside a variable

```lua
text = "Hello " .. "world!"
print(text)
```

```bash
Hello world!
```
